# Security Enhancement in Chit fund using Blockchain and Machine Learning Technologies

## Introduction

The ChitFund Implementation is a decentralized application that leverages Blockchain technology, specifically Ethereum, and incorporates Machine Learning for credit approval tests. ChitFund allows users to create or join existing chits within a trustless network. Users must pass a credit approval test to ensure their reliability before participating in chit funds.

This project includes Smart Contracts written in Solidity, which handle the conditions and regulations of the chitfund process. The Smart Contracts take care of various edge cases to ensure a secure and smooth experience for all participants.

## Objective

1. Addressing the lack of trust and issues of fraud that are happening in the present chit funds.

2. By using blockchain technology, the chit fund can be conducted in a more secure and transparent way, reducing the risk of fraud and ensuring that all participants are treated fairly.  

3. Traditional Chit funds require a lot of paperwork and it consumes most of the  time.  

4. The objective of our project is to leverage the benefits of Ethereum network blockchain technology to create a transparent and secure platform for conducting chit funds by allowing candidates on credit based approval.

## Prerequisites

To run this project locally, you'll need the following:

1. **Test Network**(https://sepolia.dev/): You need access to a test network like Sephilia Test Network to deploy and interact with the Smart Contracts.

2. **Metamask Wallet**(https://metamask.io/): Install the Metamask browser extension to manage your Ethereum wallet and transfer funds.

3. **Test Ether**(https://sepoliafaucet.com/): Make sure you have some test ether in your Metamask wallet to execute transactions on the test network.

4. **Dependencies**: Install "http-server" using the following command
```bash
npm install http-server
```

## Usage

To use the ChitFund application, follow these steps:

1. Run the following command in the pages path to open the application.
 ```bash
http-server
```
2. Run the following command in the project folder path to run the flask application for rendering the [credit approval file](templates/credit_approval.html) for credit score calculation.
 ```bash
python app.py
```
3. Connect your Metamask wallet to the application to interact with it.

5. If you are a new user, go through the credit approval process. Otherwise, proceed to register with the ChitFund company.

6. After successful registration, you can create new chits or join existing chits using the chit fund name.

7. Make sure you have sufficient test ether in your Metamask wallet to participate in the chits.

8. You can pay instalments or can participate in bid according to the chit fund policies.

## Features

1. Decentralized ChitFund application.

2. Credit approval test using Machine Learning for trust-building in the network.

3. Smart Contracts in Solidity for chitfund regulation and handling all the conditions according to chit fund policies.

4. Ability to create and join chits securely.

5. Seamless interaction with the Test Network using Metamask.
